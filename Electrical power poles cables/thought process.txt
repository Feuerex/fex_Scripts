Step 1
Add player action - become an electrician

Step 2
Once activated, player gets unarmed or equips something that doesn't shoot around
Script searches for nearby electric poles and adds a huge block on top of each one of them
Spawn a small sphere at 0,0,0

Step 3
Loop starts, whenever player looks at any huge block (invisible), move the small sphere at the block position

Step 4
Player's left and right clicks are tracked through EH. If clicked AND sphere isn't at 0,0,0, sphere disappears, and current pole is
recorded into memory. A second sphere, green, is displayed instead.

Step 5
Player's right click removes saved poles from memory and removes the green sphere. The yellow sphere only appears if
player is looking at a huge block
current position isn't already recorded as one of saved positions
yellow sphere is at 0,0,0

Step 6
When one pole is already selected and another one is picked
if poles are too far away, cancel action
if poles are reasonably far away, create a rope between them
