1) put the script from this folder to the mission folder you want to import objects into
Documents/Arma 3/missions/your mission name 
(or Documents/Arma 3 - Other profiles/profile name/missions/mission name if you use non-default profile) 
2) get the file you obtained from exporting (see Export mission for instructions), and save it as
yourScriptName.sqf into the mission folder. Remember this name.
3) create a trigger in your mission, size is irrelevant
4) trigger Condition: true
5) trigger On Activation: 
_nameOfMyDataFile = "yourScriptName.sqf";
_0 = [position thisTrigger, getDir thisTrigger, call (compile (preprocessFileLineNumbers _nameOfMyDataFile))] execVM "mapper.sqf";

obviously, replace yourScriptName with whatever you called your file
6) playtest the mission. All objects will spawn at the mission start at the position of the trigger, respecting its rotation as well.
