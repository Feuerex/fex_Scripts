Source code for the two scenarios that make up my latest cinematic

BE WARNED

The source code is
 - not organized
 - not commented
 - very hard to read
 - not standardized

Why?
It started out fairly reasonable, but eventually I had to make very quick edits, adjustments and additions,
which resulted in very unoptimized code.
I could afford this because I was fully aware I wouldn't use any of this outside of this one cinematic.
I was also running out of time and absolutely had to finish the cinematic for Dec 10th.

In this situation, speed and functionality took priority over readability and general quality of the code.

You have been warned - use at your own risk.
I will not provide any further explanation for the code. This serves only as a proof that most things I showed 
in the cinematic are indeed possible to do in vanilla Arma 3 without mods or external tools.
